## 🚀 Deployment

### ⚡ One-Click Deploy to Zeabur (Easiest)

Click the button below for one-click deployment, automatically configures LunaTV + Kvrocks database:

[![Deploy on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/templates/2425O0/deploy)

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Zero configuration, instant startup (auto-deploy complete environment)
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS and global CDN acceleration
- ✅ Persistent storage, data never lost
- ✅ Free tier sufficient for personal use

**⚠️ Important Notice**: After deployment completes, you need to set up an access domain (Domain) for the LunaTV service in Zeabur before you can access it in your browser. See the [Set Up Access Domain](#5-set-up-access-domain-required) step below for details.

After clicking the button, just fill in the environment variables to complete deployment! See [Zeabur Deployment Guide](#️-zeabur-deployment-recommended) below for details.

---

### 🐳 Docker Self-Hosted Deployment

This project **only supports Docker or Docker-based platforms** (such as Dockge, Portainer, Komodo, etc.).

### 📦 Recommended: Kvrocks Storage

Kvrocks is a persistent Redis-compatible storage based on RocksDB, recommended for production environments.

```yml
services:
  moontv-core:
    image: ghcr.io/szemeng76/lunatv:latest
    container_name: moontv-core
    restart: on-failure
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      - USERNAME=admin
      - PASSWORD=your_secure_password
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_TYPE=kvrocks
      - KVROCKS_URL=redis://moontv-kvrocks:6666
      # Optional: Site configuration
      - SITE_BASE=https://your-domain.com
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=LunaTV Enhanced
    networks:
      - moontv-network
    depends_on:
      - moontv-kvrocks

  moontv-kvrocks:
    image: apache/kvrocks
    container_name: moontv-kvrocks
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - kvrocks-data:/var/lib/kvrocks
    networks:
      - moontv-network

networks:
  moontv-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  kvrocks-data:
```

### 🔴 Redis Storage (Risk of Data Loss)

Redis default configuration may lead to data loss. Persistence must be enabled.

```yml
services:
  moontv-core:
    image: ghcr.io/szemeng76/lunatv:latest
    container_name: moontv-core
    restart: on-failure
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      - USERNAME=admin
      - PASSWORD=your_secure_password
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_TYPE=redis
      - REDIS_URL=redis://moontv-redis:6379
    networks:
      - moontv-network
    depends_on:
      - moontv-redis

  moontv-redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    container_name: moontv-redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: redis-server --save 60 1 --loglevel warning
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    networks:
      - moontv-network

networks:
  moontv-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### ☁️ Upstash Cloud Storage (Docker)

Suitable for scenarios where self-hosted databases are not available. Fully managed Redis service.

1. Register an account at [upstash.com](https://upstash.com/) and create a Redis instance
2. Copy **HTTPS ENDPOINT** and **TOKEN**
3. Use the following configuration:

```yml
services:
  moontv-core:
    image: ghcr.io/szemeng76/lunatv:latest
    container_name: moontv-core
    restart: on-failure
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      - USERNAME=admin
      - PASSWORD=your_secure_password
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_TYPE=upstash
      - UPSTASH_URL=https://your-instance.upstash.io
      - UPSTASH_TOKEN=your_upstash_token
```

### ☁️ Zeabur Deployment (Recommended)

Zeabur is a one-stop cloud deployment platform. Using pre-built Docker images allows for quick deployment without waiting for builds.

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **Add KVRocks Service** (Add database first)
   - Click "Add Service" > "Docker Images"
   - Enter image name: `apache/kvrocks`
   - Configure port: `6666` (TCP)
   - **Remember the service name** (usually `apachekvrocks`)
   - **Configure Persistent Volume (Important)**:
     * Find "Volumes" section in service settings
     * Click "Add Volume" to add new volume
     * Volume ID: `kvrocks-data` (customizable, only letters, numbers, and hyphens)
     * Path: `/var/lib/kvrocks/db`
     * Save configuration

   > 💡 **Important**: Persistent volume path must be set to `/var/lib/kvrocks/db` (KVRocks data directory). This keeps config files in the container while persisting database files, preventing data loss on restart!

2. **Add LunaTV Service**
   - Click "Add Service" > "Docker Images"
   - Enter image name: `ghcr.io/szemeng76/lunatv:latest`
   - Configure port: `3000` (HTTP)

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Add the following environment variables to your LunaTV service:

   ```env
   # Required: Admin Account
   USERNAME=admin
   PASSWORD=your_secure_password

   # Required: Storage Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_TYPE=kvrocks
   KVROCKS_URL=redis://apachekvrocks:6666

   # Optional: Site Configuration
   SITE_BASE=https://your-domain.zeabur.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=LunaTV Enhanced
   ANNOUNCEMENT=Welcome to LunaTV Enhanced Edition

   # Optional: Douban Proxy (Recommended)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DOUBAN_PROXY_TYPE=cmliussss-cdn-tencent
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DOUBAN_IMAGE_PROXY_TYPE=cmliussss-cdn-tencent
   ```

   **Note**:
   - Use service name as hostname: `redis://apachekvrocks:6666`
   - Replace with actual service name if different
   - Both services must be in the same Project

4. **Deployment Complete**
   - Zeabur will automatically pull images and start services
   - After services are ready, you need to manually set up an access domain (see next step)

#### 5. Set Up Access Domain (Required)

   - In the LunaTV service page, click the "Networking" or "Network" tab
   - Click "Generate Domain" to create a free Zeabur domain (e.g., `xxx.zeabur.app`)
   - Or bind a custom domain:
     * Click "Add Domain" to add your domain
     * Follow the prompts to configure DNS CNAME record pointing to the Zeabur-provided target
   - Once the domain is set up, you can access LunaTV through the domain

6. **Bind Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - In service settings, click "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain
   - Configure DNS CNAME record to point to the Zeabur-provided domain

#### 🔄 Updating Docker Images

When a new Docker image version is released, Zeabur won't automatically update. Manual trigger is required.

**Update Steps:**

1. **Enter Service Page**
   - Click on the service you want to update (LunaTV or KVRocks)

2. **Restart Service**
   - Click on the **"Overview"** page, and then click the **"Restart"** button
   - Zeabur will automatically pull the latest `latest` image and redeploy

> 💡 **Tips**:
> - When using `latest` tag, Restart will automatically pull the latest image
> - For production environments, it's recommended to use fixed version tags (e.g., `v5.5.5`) to avoid unexpected updates

#### ✨ Zeabur Deployment Advantages

- ✅ **Automatic HTTPS**: Free SSL certificate auto-configured
- ✅ **Global CDN**: Built-in worldwide acceleration
- ✅ **Zero-Config Deployment**: Automatic Dockerfile detection
- ✅ **Service Discovery**: Containers communicate via service names automatically
- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: Volume mounting support
- ✅ **CI/CD Integration**: Auto-deployment on Git push
- ✅ **Real-time Logs**: Web interface for runtime logs

#### ⚠️ Zeabur Considerations

- **Pricing Model**: Pay-as-you-go based on actual resource usage, free tier sufficient for small projects
- **Region Selection**: Recommend choosing the region closest to your users
- **Service Networking**: Services in the same Project communicate via service names (e.g., `apachekvrocks:6666`)
- **Persistent Storage**: KVRocks must configure persistent volume to `/var/lib/kvrocks/db` directory, otherwise data will be lost on restart
